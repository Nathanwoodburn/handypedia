# Niami

![niami_logo.png](/niami_logo.png){.align-right}
Niami allows users to discover Handshake domain names from secondary domain markets like Namebase or Shakedex. The site also provides a Handshake block explorer, a portfolio manager, name ratings and the ability to open, bid on, or reveal names via Bob Wallet's browser extension.

## History
Niami was published on October, 27th 2020. The site was created by [0xstefan](https://twitter.com/0xStefan). The domain auction features and the Handshake explorer were added later on September 15, 2021.

## Features
### Ratings
Ratings are automatically created for domain names that have at least been in a "REVEAL" state. Domain names can get up to 10,000 points but can never fall below 0. Each domain name starts with a score of 500. The calculation system rewards but also punishes names. For example a name gets rewarded if it's short or if it had a high auction price. It gets punished if it contains a hyphen or underscore or if it's not a word in any of the [supported languages](https://www.niami.io/faq).

### Handshake Explorer
The Handshake explorer allows its users to search and navigate the Handshake blockchain. It can be used (among other things) to check current and historical address balances, transfer histories or status of transaction confirmations.

### Domain Name Auctions
The domain name auction feature in combination with [Bob Wallet](/en/bobwallet)'s browser extension allows users to search, open, bid on or reveal names.

### Handshake Portfolio
In January 2022, Niami introduced "Handshake Portfolio" to help users share and discover valuable domain names.
