# HNS Fund Team

The HNS Fund follows a [holocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) model where each team is independent and autonomous with complete control of how they operate and spend the resources allocated to them. Teams in the [HNS Fund DAO](https://en.handypedia.org/wiki/HNS_Fund) are organized groups of Handshake community members that would like to contribute to the HNS ecosystem. Teams are funded through the HNS Fund Master Multisig based on total donations for that month. Each team organizes internally in whatever way works for them and gets positive results. Each team controls their own multisig and can use their funds however without requiring approval from any other team or Master Multisig signers

## Grants Program
Grants go out to dedicated HNS community members who are continuously providing valuable contributions to the ecosystem. Grants can be for completely discretionary use or may have targeted features/conditions tied to it which will be discussed with grant recipients before they accept and receive their funding. You can view grant recipients on our [Grant Rounds page](/en/hnsfund_rounds).

## Bounties Program
The Bounties Team manages open bounties in the HNS ecosystem. These could be to upgrade the HNS protocol, add a feature to an open source product like Bob Wallet, translating handy.wiki content to other languages, or really anything the see fit to develop the HNS ecosystem. They are responsible for vetting bounty requests, properly speccing out completion criteria, ensuring bounties are easy to participate in e.g. by providing supporting docs for a job, verifying bounty has been adequately completed, and distributing payments to winner. We maintain a spreadsheet of open bounties and payment transactions.
