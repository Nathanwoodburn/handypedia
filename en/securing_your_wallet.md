# Securing your wallet

## Tips to secure your HNS

**Security should be a very important concern for any HNS user (and web 3 in general).**

Here's few very useful security tips for securing your HNS wallet and securing you while browsing HNS sites:

- Not your keys - not your money
This very simple rule applies to all cryptocurrencies. Do not use exchanges / light wallets (with wallet management from the heavy version on the server) and so on. If you need to buy a domain, and you want to do it using [Namebase](https://www.namebase.io), transfer there exactly as many coins as you need to buy this domain. To store HNS, it is better to use wallets that do not send your private keys anywhere, and interact with the blockchain directly from your PC. One of the really safe wallets for HNS is the [bob wallet](https://bobwallet.io)

- Securely store your seed phrases and private keys
Don't store it in .txt file on desktop! Better take a piece of paper, and write seed there. It's more safe.

- Don't use handshake bridges
If you're an active user of HNS sites, the worst thing you can do is add hns.is at the end of domains handshake. HNS bridges proxy all traffic of sites that you visit with it through itself, so it can modify content of sites, insert ads or even steal your cookies/passwords If you want to use hns sites on a permanent basis, you should install the resolver software.
