# Auction

To prevent price sniping, Handshake uses a blind second-price auction called a Vickrey Auction. Users can buy and register top-level domains (TLDs) with Handshake coins (HNS).

In a Vickrey Auction, a participant is only aware of their own bid. The bids are revealed at the end of the auction when a winner is chosen. The winner pays the second highest bid instead of his or her own.

- Names were released weekly during a pre-determined 52 week schedule (until Feb 2021)

- Blind bids can be placed any time after a name is released.

- Bidding is open to everyone for 5 days beforethe reveal period.

- Bidders have 10 days to reveal their bid price.

- A winner is assigned the name and pays the second highest bid at the end of the reveal period.

- The winning bid is burned and permanently removed from circulation.

- Losing bids are returned.

- Names are renewed every 2 years by paying standard network fee.
