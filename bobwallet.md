# Bob Wallet

[Bob Wallet](https://bobwallet.io) is Handshake’s premiere non-custodial wallet option built by the [Kyokan team](https://www.kyokan.io/)



## Features
Search and bid on domain names
Manage domains and DNS records
Send, receive, and claim HNS
Run a full Handshake node

## Chrome Extension
Bob wallet has a chrome extension similar to MetaMask where you can interact with Happs (Handshake Apps) like Shakedex and Niami through your browser. The extension allows you to search and bid on names, send and receive HNS, and manage Handshake TLDs. It runs a light weight SPV node and also doubles as a Resolver for Handshake names though https://www.hdns.io/.

## Claiming HNS
If you had a GitHub account with 15 or more followers in February of 2019, you were entitled to an airdrop of 4,662.598321 HNS. Bob wallet has a built in tool that makes it easy for FOSS developers to claim this HNS under the “Add Funds” tab

## Shakedex integration
Bob wallet has a built in integration with shakedex where you can list and buy domains in a decentralized manner under the “Exchange” tab. Listed names start at their highest price and decline gradually to their reserve price over a specified time frame.
