# FireWallet
![favicon.png](/firewallet/favicon.png =256x256){.align-right}
A fully opensource Handshake wallet that is just Fire.


## FireWallet Browser
FireWallet Browser is a python application that connects to any HSD node and hosts a web based wallet.
It allows for sharing the wallet over a VPN or local network to a mobile device without the connecting device needing a HSD node.
FireWallet Browser allows for custom plugins to be added. They are easy to code in Python so anyone can create them.
Plugins can get [Niami](/niami) ratings for your domain, automatically set the DNS to a varo clone or even automate a WordPress site setup.


### Features
- Basic wallet functionality such as creating/importing wallets and sending/recieving HNS and domains
- Sending to HIP2 domain aliases (this allows you to send HNS and domains to domains like @nathan.woodburn)
- Download a list of all domains in a customizable format
- Resend all pending transactions
- Easy theming
- Custom plugins
