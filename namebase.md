# Namebase

![namebase_wordmark.png](/namebase_wordmark.png){.align-right}

[Namebase](https://www.namebase.io) is an onramp for Handshake. Namebase did not create Handshake but is a member of its community.
"Our mission is to enable freedom and safety on the internet"
Namebase's goal is to make Handshake easy-to-use to enable mass adoption, and you can use the platform to easily buy and sell HNS as well as bid on, purchase, sell, and use Handshake names.

## Revenue Streams
While Handshake is a non-profit movement, Namebase is a for-profit company building on Handshake. Its [revenue streams](https://learn.namebase.io/about-namebase/revenue-streams) include:

### Exchange
While you may see other exchanges list HNS, Namebase is the only one fully focused on unlocking Handshake's potential. [Namebase Consumer](https://www.namebase.io/buy) can be used to purchase HNS with BTC or USD. There are no trading fees and the exchange aims to price HNS with a spread of 1-3% depending on market conditions.

### Namebase Pro
[Namebase Pro](https://www.namebase.io/pro) can be used trade HNS for BTC using a traditional order book exchange similar to Binance and Coinbase Pro. Namebase Pro has some of the lowest trading fees (0.1% maker fee and 0% taker fee). Due to cryptocurrency regulations, those within the USA are currently unable to access Namebase Pro.

### Bidding
Namebase's [bidding service](https://namebase.io/domains) makes it possible for anyone to participate in Handshake name auctions without needing to be a developer. No fees are charged for the bidding services. The mining fees that are charged for bid placements are paid to the miners who add your transactions to the Handshake blockchain, and do not get paid to Namebase.

### Marketplace
The [Namebase Marketplace](https://namebase.io/domains) makes it easy to sell or purchase owned Handshake names. A 3% commission fee to sellers is collected when your name successfully sells.

### Namebase Registry
The [Namebase Registry](https://www.namebase.io/registry) is a service that enables you to sell 2nd-level domains on your Handshake TLD. Namebase partnered with the creator of the .io registry to create this service that is compatible with existing registrars, making it easy to plug directly into their existing distribution channels. The Namebase Registry operates on a revenue-sharing model — after a $1 processing fee, 70% of proceeds go to the TLD owner and 30% go to Namebase.

## Backers
Namebase is a [VC-backed company](https://namebase.io/about). Some of its backers include Fred Ehrsam of Paradigm, Balaji Srinivasan of Earn.com, Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano of Morgan Creek Capital, Eric Meltzer of Primitive Ventures, Robert Leshner of Compound Labs, Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures, and Josh Elman of Greylock Partners.

## Verifying
Namebase is an incorporated company that has to follow normal AML/KYC laws like other onramps such as Coinbase. Learn more about their verification requirements here.

It is still possible to use Namebase to acquire Handshake names [entirely privately](https://learn.namebase.io/about-namebase/private-naming) without revealing any personal information.
