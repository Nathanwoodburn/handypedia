## Burning
At the end of a [TLD auction](/en/auction) all the money paid by the winner do not go to anyone, it is burned (locked away and never usable again).

According to [Shake Stats](https://shakestats.com/) the HNS analytics website, over 1% of the total HNS supply has already been burned in auctions.

Many Handshake community members have embraced the burn meme and incorporated burning HNS into their applications like [shakedex](https://shakedex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community_burn.html)
