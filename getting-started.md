## Get a Handshake name

There are a few ways to get a name on Handshake:

- Buying directly from Handshake via [auction process](/en/auction).
- Buying from a secondhand marked.
- Claim a [reserved name](/en/reserved_names).

**Namebase**
Visit [https://www.namebase.io/domains](https://www.namebase.io/domains) and use the search to find names you want to own.

**Owned — listed for sale**
This name's auction ended, the name is owned by someone else and it's up for sale — you can immediately purchase it. If the seller has enabled "Make an Offer", you'll also be able to make them an offer for their name.

**Owned — unlisted**
This name's auction ended, the name is owned by someone else and it isn't up for sale. If the owner has enabled "Make an Offer", you'll be able to make them an offer on their name.

**Unopened auction**
This Handshake name auction hasn't started and placing a bid on this — around 30 minutes to confirm — will begin the auction.

**Active auction**
This Handshake name auction is underway.

**Revealing**
This name's auction recently ended and the winner will receive their name once the reveal period ends.

**Reserved**
This name is either one of the existing ~1,500 blacklisted traditional TLDs or is reserved for a top 100,000 Alexa website.
